# AI_Practicals
# üî¨ Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing Practicals ‚Äì Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python-based implementations for practical problems in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. Each program solves a specific problem and serves as a hands-on exercise in AI and NLP concepts using open-source tools like NLTK and Scikit-learn.
